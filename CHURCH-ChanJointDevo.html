            <p>
                The Narra Cottage and Channon Hall Joint Devotion brought together dormers from two distinct residences for a shared church event. The gathering served as a moment of relaxation for the dormers, offering prayers and good wishes as they approached the upcoming midterm exams. Beyond the spiritual aspect, the event fostered a sense of community and interaction between the residents of Narra Cottage and Channon Hall.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h1 class="contentTitle">SO WHAT?</h1>
            <p>
                The joint devotion, while centered around a church event, extended beyond mere religious observance. It functioned as a collective effort to provide comfort and well-wishes to dormers ahead of midterm exams. The inclusion of snacks and games elevated the experience, transforming it into a wholesome and enjoyable gathering. The interaction between residents of Narra Cottage and Channon Hall added a layer of community building, showcasing the value of shared moments beyond the academic context.            </p>
            <br>
            <h1 class="contentTitle">NOW WHAT?</h1>
            <p>
                The Joint Devotion has left a positive impact, highlighting the importance of community and support within the dormitory environment. The experience has inspired a greater appreciation for shared moments of relaxation and encouragement. Moving forward, I am inclined to actively participate in similar events, recognizing the significance of building connections with fellow dormers and fostering a supportive and inclusive living community.
