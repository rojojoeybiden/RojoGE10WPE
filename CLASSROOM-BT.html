                The "Balik Talent Lecture - Success: Itâ€™s All About the Mindset" was a thoughtfully organized event by the College of Computer Studies (CCS). The lecture featured former CCS students returning to Silliman University to share their personal journeys and insights, aiming to motivate new freshmen as they embark on their own academic and professional journeys. The event was a unique opportunity for the fresh students to gain inspiration from the experiences of those who had walked the same paths before them.
