            <p>
                As a dedicated member of the Aesthetics Committee, I actively participated in the preparations for the upcoming Parada Sillimaniana event. This event, which holds significance in the university's calendar, required meticulous planning and coordination to ensure a visually appealing and cohesive representation. Being part of the committee, I engaged in collaborative efforts to contribute to the overall aesthetic appeal of our representation in the parade.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h1 class="contentTitle">SO WHAT?</h1>
            <p>
                Involvement in the Aesthetics Committee for the Parada Sillimaniana proved to be a fulfilling experience. Beyond the tasks at hand, the event provided a platform for meaningful interactions with fellow freshies, leading to the formation of connections that evolved into strong friendships. The preparation phase not only enhanced the visual appeal of our representation but also underscored the importance of togetherness in creating a positive and memorable college experience.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h1 class="contentTitle">NOW WHAT?</h1>
            <p>
                The experience with the Aesthetics Committee underscored the value of collaborative efforts in creating a vibrant and engaging representation for university events. The connections formed during the preparation for Parada Sillimaniana emphasized the significance of building relationships with fellow students. Moving forward, I am inspired to actively seek and contribute to similar collaborative initiatives, recognizing that togetherness is a crucial element in fostering a positive and enriching college experience.  
            </p>

            <p>
                Because of my involvement in the Aesthetics Committee for Parada Sillimaniana, I am motivated to actively participate in collaborative efforts that contribute to the visual and experiential aspects of university events. The connections made during the preparation phase have highlighted the importance of togetherness in creating a positive college experience. This experience has instilled in me a sense of commitment to actively engage in collaborative initiatives that enhance the overall vibrancy of the university community.
