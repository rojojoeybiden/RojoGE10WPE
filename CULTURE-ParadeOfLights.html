                The "Parade of Lights," organized by Silliman University, unfolded as a dazzling display featuring various colleges showcasing their unique flair. This event was a parade that transcended simplicity, with some colleges opting for the elegance of lightsticks, while others went all out, adorning vehicles and large props with lights to captivate both audiences and passersby. The event highlighted the strong sense of connection among the university's colleges, with each demonstrating dedication and loyalty to their respective institutions. Although my college, CCS, didn't partake in the parade to the best of my knowledge, the event was a testament to the unity and loyalty within the Silliman University community.

            <p>
                The "Parade of Lights" left a lasting impression due to the striking displays of loyalty from each college, fostering a sense of pride and motivation. Witnessing the commitment of other students motivated me to reciprocate that loyalty to my own college, CCS. The event was a testament to the university's vibrant community spirit. While my college may not have participated this time, the anticipation for the next year's parade stirs a desire to contribute actively and be part of the dynamic procession through the streets of Dumaguete City.

                The "Parade of Lights" has deepened my connection to the Silliman University community and instilled a sense of pride and loyalty to my college, CCS. The event serves as a reminder of the strong bonds within the university and motivates me to actively engage in future activities. Looking ahead, I aspire to contribute to the vibrancy of the event, hoping that CCS will participate next time, and I can be among those proudly marching through the streets, representing my college.
