            <p>
                Dorm Day, an annual celebration across all dormitories in Silliman University, brings dorm living into the spotlight. As a participant in Dorm Day, I had the opportunity to contribute to the festivities by joining a performance with my dormmates. Our act involved dancing Tinikling onstage, creating a memorable and enjoyable experience. Dorm Day, through this celebration, imparted the valuable lesson of finding joy and contentment in the present moment.

            <p>
                Being part of the Tinikling performance during Dorm Day emerged as one of the highlights of my Silliman University experience. The event itself, dedicated to celebrating dormitory living, underscored the importance of appreciating and finding happiness in one's current circumstances. The act of dancing and participating in the festivities not only added a sense of joy to the occasion but also instilled a broader perspective on the significance of embracing and enjoying the present.

                Dorm Day has left a lasting impact, emphasizing the importance of being content and finding happiness in the current phase of life. The experience of actively participating in the celebration has instilled a sense of gratitude for dormitory living and the community it fosters. Moving forward, I am inspired to carry this lesson, recognizing the value of embracing and being happy with where I am in the present.
