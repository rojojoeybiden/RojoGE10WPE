            <p>
                "Christian Zionism: A Public Forum" was a thought-provoking event orchestrated by Mr. Villarmea, my CHS teacher, in collaboration with Silliman University's Religion and Peace Studies Department. The forum delved into the complex situation between Israel and Palestine. Each section taught by Mr. Villarmea, including mine, was tasked with creating a PowerPoint presentation addressing the subject matter. While I served on the technical team and wasn't involved in the presentation creation, the event showcased diverse and passionate opinions on the Israel-Palestine situation.

            <br>
            <h1 class="contentTitle">SO WHAT?</h1>
            <p>
                Participating in the technical team for "Christian Zionism: A Public Forum" provided a unique perspective on the strong opinions and discussions surrounding the Israel-Palestine issue. It was heartening to witness the engagement and awareness of the university community on the complex realities faced by the people in Gaza. The event highlighted the importance of fostering open dialogue and informed discussions about global issues, even when perspectives are strongly divided.

            <h1 class="contentTitle">NOW WHAT?</h1>
            <p>
                The forum experience has reinforced the significance of creating platforms for informed discussions on global issues. As a participant in the technical team, I am motivated to continue supporting events that encourage awareness and dialogue on complex geopolitical matters. Moving forward, I am inspired to stay informed and engaged in discussions that contribute to a deeper understanding of global challenges.
