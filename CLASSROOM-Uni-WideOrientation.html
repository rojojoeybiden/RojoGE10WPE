            <p>
                The University-Wide Orientation for Freshie and New Students, hosted by the SUSG Committee on Student Organization, unfolded within the Claire Isabel McGill Luce Auditorium. This event aimed to provide a warm welcome to freshmen and transferees, introducing them to the vibrant community at Silliman University. Among the various activities during the orientation, one notable performance stood outâ€”a unique theatrical presentation where individuals backstage spoke through microphones, and actors on stage enacted the spoken words. This innovative performance left a lasting impression and showcased the diverse talents within the university.

            <br>
            <h1 class="contentTitle">SO WHAT?</h1>
            <p>
                The orientation event was a rich and multifaceted experience, but the standout memory was the distinctive backstage-and-onstage performance. Witnessing my dormmate and friend, Fort, deliver a commendable performance added a personal and memorable touch to the event. His skillful act sparked admiration for the dedication and effort that goes into such performances. This experience deepened my respect for Silliman University, recognizing its commitment to providing platforms for students to showcase their talents and shine on the stage.

            <h1 class="contentTitle">NOW WHAT?</h1>
            <p>
                The University-Wide Orientation has left a positive impression, emphasizing the opportunities for students to express their talents and creativity within the university community. The impactful performance by Fort has inspired me to explore and showcase my own talents in future events. Moving forward, I am eager to engage in university activities that encourage self-expression and highlight the diverse capabilities of the student body.

This experience has reinforced my belief in the importance of self-expression and the role it plays in creating a vibrant and supportive university environment.
