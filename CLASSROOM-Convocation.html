            <p>
                The All University Academic Convocation unfolded within the grand setting of Claire Isabel McGill Luce Auditorium, gathering students to partake in an essential assembly. The focal point of the event was a discourse on artificial intelligence and its profound impact on equitable education in contemporary times. As attendees, we delved into the intricate implications of AI in shaping educational experiences, sparking reflections on the role of technology in the learning environment.

            <p>
                The Academic Convocation delved into a thought-provoking exploration of artificial intelligence and its implications for fair education. The discourse resonated with me on a personal level, given my reliance on generative AI tools like ChatGPT and Google Bard. While these tools offer assistance, there's an underlying unease knowing that the content might not be crafted by a living mind but rather a machine learning algorithm predicting logical responses to prompts. The event stimulated a sense of contemplation about the delicate balance between technology and the human touch, particularly in the realm of education.

            <h1 class="contentTitle">NOW WHAT?</h1>
            <p>
                The Academic Convocation has instigated a renewed appreciation for the irreplaceable value of human creativity and craftsmanship. Despite the efficiency of AI creations, the conviction remains strong that human-made work will always possess a unique depth and authenticity. This experience prompts a commitment to upholding the significance of human contributions in the face of technological advancements, advocating for the enduring importance of genuine human creativity in various aspects of life, including education.

            <p>
                Because of the insights gained from the All University Academic Convocation, I am resolute in my belief that human-made work holds an unparalleled depth and authenticity compared to AI creations. The event has deepened my appreciation for the unique qualities that human creativity brings to education and other realms of life. Moving forward, I am committed to championing the enduring value of genuine human contributions in the face of technological progress.
