                The CCS Trivia, an engaging event created by the Confederate Student Council of CCS, brought students together for an intellectually stimulating experience. The trivia encompassed a wide range of topics related to CCS, spanning from coding questions to the entertaining challenge of identifying faculty members through blurry photos. The event aimed to test participants' knowledge about all things CCS, fostering a sense of camaraderie and friendly competition.

                The CCS Trivia event has sparked an interest in exploring diverse aspects of CCS beyond the standard academic curriculum. The fun and engaging format of the trivia has inspired me to delve deeper into coding and other facets of CCS, fostering a holistic understanding of the field. Moving forward, I am inclined to participate in similar events to broaden my knowledge and connect with fellow students who share a passion for the diverse facets of computer studies.
