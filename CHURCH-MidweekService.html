            <p>
                The CCS Midweek Service, a collaborative effort between Silliman University Church and the College of Computer Studies, is a church service exclusively designed for CCS students. Although I didn't attend the service inside the church, as it was intended only for second-year CCS students, the atmosphere around the church was notable. The significant turnout indicated a strong presence of CCS students eager to participate in the event.

            <h1 class="contentTitle">SO WHAT?</h1>
            <p>
                While I didn't have the opportunity to attend the CCS Midweek Service inside the church, the visible turnout and wait outside suggested a palpable interest among CCS students. The event, organized by both the university church and the College of Computer Studies, highlighted the significance of fostering a sense of community and shared spirituality within the academic setting. The strong attendance showcased a collective desire among CCS students to engage in communal activities that transcend academic pursuits.</p>

            <h1 class="contentTitle">NOW WHAT?</h1>
            <p>
                The CCS Midweek Service has sparked an awareness of the importance of spiritual and communal connections within the academic environment. Although I didn't participate fully this time, the experience has inspired a commitment to exploring and engaging in such events in the future. Moving forward, I am inclined to actively seek opportunities to connect with the spiritual and communal aspects of university life, recognizing their value in creating a well-rounded academic experience.

                Because of the CCS Midweek Service, I am inspired to actively explore and engage in spiritual and communal events within the university setting. The notable turnout outside the church has reinforced the importance of fostering connections beyond academic pursuits. Moving forward, I am committed to participating in such events, recognizing the value they add to the overall university experience and the sense of community within the College of Computer Studies.
