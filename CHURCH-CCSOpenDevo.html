            <p>
                The CCS Opening Devotion gathered CCS students at ATA Hall for a dedicated time of spiritual reflection. As someone who isn't religious, I attended the event with the intention of including it in my WPE journal. Rev. January B. Alpuerto led the devotion, titled "God's Algorithm," exploring the concept rooted in discussions on solving the Rubikâ€™s cube puzzle, applicable to various puzzles and mathematical games.

            <h1 class="contentTitle">SO WHAT?</h1>
            <p>
                Attending the CCS Opening Devotion provided unexpected insights into the inclusive nature of religious events at Silliman University. Rev. Jan's approach was pleasantly surprising, lacking the typical preachiness often associated with religious gatherings. The incorporation of computer-related tidbits in her devotion, especially with a topic like "God's Algorithm," revealed a nuanced and open-minded perspective. Despite my lack of religious affiliation, I found myself genuinely intrigued by the content, realizing that meaningful and interesting discussions can transcend religious boundaries.

            <br>
            <h1 class="contentTitle">NOW WHAT?</h1>
            <p>
                The experience at the CCS Opening Devotion challenged my preconceptions about religious events, highlighting the welcoming environment at Silliman University. It prompted a recognition that, despite my non-religious stance, I can engage with and appreciate discussions that draw connections between spirituality and other fields of interest, such as computer-related topics. Moving forward, I aim to approach similar events with an open mind, recognizing the potential for enriching experiences beyond personal beliefs.
            </p>

            <p>
                Because of this event, I am encouraged to embrace the diverse experiences offered at Silliman University, recognizing that meaningful and thought-provoking discussions can be found in unexpected places, even in events that are traditionally religious. The CCS Opening Devotion has inspired me to approach such occasions with an open mind, fostering an appreciation for the diverse perspectives that contribute to the university's inclusive community.
