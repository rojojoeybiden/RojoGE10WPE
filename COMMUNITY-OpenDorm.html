            <p>
                Being a resident of Narra Cottage, my participation in the Open Dorm/Open House event was a given. This event, where all dormitories within Silliman University opened their doors for exploration, aimed to showcase the unique dormitory experience. As part of Narra Cottage, I welcomed the opportunity to share and explore the living spaces with others. Additionally, I had the chance to venture into Edith Carson Hall and Doltz Hall, fostering a sense of connection among the various dormitories.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h1 class="contentTitle">SO WHAT?</h1>
            <p>
                The Open Dorm event proved to be an intriguing and enjoyable experience. Witnessing people exploring and engaging with the dormitories, including my own, added a layer of community and camaraderie. The chance to explore other dorms like Edith Carson Hall and Doltz Hall provided insights into different living environments. The event created a sense of connection among dormitory residents, fostering anticipation for future renditions and the opportunity to continue building connections.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h1 class="contentTitle">NOW WHAT?</h1>
            <p>
                The Open Dorm event has sparked an appreciation for the diverse living experiences within the university. It serves as a reminder of the sense of community that extends beyond individual dorms. Looking forward, I am excited to participate in future Open Dorm events, fostering connections, and sharing experiences with fellow dormitory residents.
            </p>

            <p>
                Because of my involvement in the Open Dorm event, I am motivated to appreciate and actively contribute to the sense of community within the university's dormitory environment. The event has inspired me to look forward to future editions, where I can continue to connect with fellow residents and share in the unique experiences of different dormitories. This experience has reinforced my commitment to fostering a positive and inclusive living community within Silliman University.
