            <p>
                The SU Campus Ambassador Tour, assigned as an alternative to GE10 classes, unfolded as an engaging and informative event organized by the SUSG Committee on Student Organization. The tour was led by two representatives who navigated students through various campus locations, sharing intriguing facts and stories along the way. An example included the explanation that the orange doors on the second floor of the CBA building serve as evacuation areas during emergencies. Another fascinating tidbit was the book held by the Hibbard statue in Hibbard Hall being "The First Quarter by Hibbard." This unique experience offered a blend of historical insights and fun facts about the campus.
