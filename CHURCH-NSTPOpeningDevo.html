            <p>
                The NSTP Opening Devotion marked the commencement of the NSTP Orientation at Silliman University Ballfield, beginning at 06:00. This event preceded the orientation and provided students with insights into the three NSTP programs offered by the university: ROTC, CWTS, and LTS (I personally opted for LTS). The ceremony served as an early-morning energizer and included a prayer component for those inclined towards religious practices. My role in the activity was that of an attendee, witnessing the diverse NSTP offerings and the university's connection to the church, highlighting the inclusive environment at Silliman University.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h1 class="contentTitle">SO WHAT?</h1>
            <p>
                The NSTP Opening Devotion offered a unique perspective on the interconnectedness of the university and its commitment to diverse beliefs. As someone that's not religious, it served as a spiritual and motivational start to the day, aligning with my expectations of an energizing and spiritually uplifting experience. The inclusivity demonstrated during the event was a pleasant surprise, emphasizing the university's openness to various religious backgrounds, including those who are not religious. The impactful moments included witnessing the unity of students from different programs, fostering a sense of community.            </p>
            <br>
            <h1 class="contentTitle">NOW WHAT?</h1>
            <p>
                This experience deepened my appreciation for the diverse and inclusive culture at Silliman University. It highlighted the importance of communal gatherings and spiritual practices, shaping my view of the university's commitment to holistic education. Moving forward, I aim to actively engage in university events that promote unity and understanding among students with varying beliefs. The benefits of such gatherings lie in fostering a harmonious campus environment that values diversity. If given the opportunity to revisit this event, I would seek to actively participate in discussions that promote interfaith dialogue and understanding.
            </p>

            <p>
                Because of this activity, I am more cognizant of the university's commitment to diversity and inclusivity, and I am motivated to contribute actively to initiatives that foster unity and understanding among students of different backgrounds and beliefs.
